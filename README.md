      Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by SHAPEAI . The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

        I got to have experience on:
        
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
        during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit: www.shapeai.tech or follow SHAPEAI on:
